# BadenLEG: Start Here 🚀

**Created:** Feb 2, 2026
**Goal:** Acquisition by Regionalwerke Baden (Aug 2026)
**Status:** Planning complete, ready to execute

---

## TL;DR

You have **6 months** to turn BadenLEG into a CHF 300-500K acquisition target for Regionalwerke Baden.

**The Plan:**
1. **Feb-Mar (6 weeks):** Get 500+ verified households registered
2. **Mar-May (8 weeks):** Build formation wizard, activate 20 communities
3. **May-Jun (6 weeks):** Create utility ops dashboard + export package
4. **Jun-Aug (8 weeks):** Pitch, negotiate, close acquisition

**Why This Works:**
- Regionalwerke MUST support LEG (legal requirement since Jan 1, 2026)
- Building internal platform costs them CHF 300-500K + 12 months
- You'll have 500+ verified, consented customers ready to activate
- You'll have proven formation process + operational tools
- Acquisition is their fastest, cheapest path to LEG compliance

**Your Next Action (Monday Feb 3):**
1. Deploy live counter to homepage (2h)
2. Launch Facebook ads (CHF 100/day) (1h)
3. Email 10 solar installers for partnerships (2h)
4. Set up email automation (2h)

## Key Principles (Remember These)

### 1. **Acquisition Value Over Feature Completeness**
Every feature decision: "Does this prove acquisition value?"
- More verified households? ✅ Build it
- Better UX polish? ❌ Skip it
- Utility handoff package? ✅ Build it
- Mobile app? ❌ Skip it

### 2. **Speed Over Perfection**
Ship fast, iterate faster.
- Week 1: Homepage updates + ads launch
- Week 2: User dashboard MVP
- Week 7: Formation wizard V1
- Don't wait for perfect, ship functional

### 3. **Measure Everything**
Track weekly:
- Registrations (target: 500 by May)
- Communities forming (target: 20 by Jun)
- Utility consent rate (target: 70%+)
- Cost per registration (target: < CHF 40)

### 4. **Focus on Proof Points**
Regionalwerke buys 4 things:
1. **Verified demand** (registered, consented households)
2. **Formation capability** (communities reaching "ready" state)
3. **Utility handoff package** (clean exports, consent management)
4. **Operational readiness** (dashboard, case handling, audit trail)

Build these. Nothing else matters.

### 5. **Marketing = 50% of Success**
Don't just build, promote:
- Facebook ads (CHF 3K budget)
- Partnerships (10 solar installers)
- PR (press releases, media outreach)
- Referral program (viral growth)

## Your Mindset for the Next 6 Months

**This is a sprint, not a marathon.**

You have:
- **480 hours** of development time
- **CHF 5,000** marketing budget
- **26 weeks** to prove the case
- **1 shot** to get this right

But you also have:
- ✅ **Working infrastructure** (PostgreSQL, referrals, analytics)
- ✅ **Complete plan** (this documentation)
- ✅ **Clear goal** (CHF 300-500K acquisition)
- ✅ **Proven model** (LEG is legal, demand exists)
- ✅ **Motivated buyer** (Regionalwerke needs LEG solution)

**You don't need to be perfect. You need to be fast.**

Ship weekly. Learn daily. Adjust constantly.

6 months from now, you're either:
1. ✅ Closing a CHF 300-500K acquisition
2. ✅ Running a sustainable CHF 100K+ ARR business
3. ❌ Still "planning" (don't let this happen)

---

## The First Action (Right Now)

Close this document.

Open IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md.

Find "Week 1: Launch (Feb 3-9)" section.

Look at Monday's tasks.

Open TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md Section 1.1.

Copy the code.

## Questions to Ask Yourself Weekly

### Every Monday Morning
1. Did I hit last week's registration target?
2. What channel is working best?
3. What should I build this week?
4. What should I NOT build?
5. Am I on track for acquisition readiness?

### Every Friday Afternoon
1. Did I ship this week's features?
2. Are they working in production?
3. What metrics improved?
4. What surprised me this week?
5. What will I do differently next week?

---

## A Note on Perfection

This plan is comprehensive, but it's not perfect.

You'll discover:
- Features that don't work as expected
- Marketing channels that underperform
- User needs you didn't anticipate
- Technical challenges you didn't foresee

**That's fine. Expected. Normal.**

The plan is your starting point, not your prison.

Adjust weekly based on data.
Stay focused on acquisition value.
Keep shipping.

---

## Good Luck 🚀

You've done the hard part (planning).

Now comes the fun part (building).

6 months. CHF 300-500K exit. Let's go.

**Start Monday. Execute relentlessly. Exit by August.**
