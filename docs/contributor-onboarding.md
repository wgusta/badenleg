# Contributor onboarding

## What OpenLEG is

OpenLEG is open source infrastructure for Swiss Local Electricity Communities, known as LEGs. It combines the public website, product application, and API used to found and operate a LEG. This repository owns that public product; production deployment belongs outside it.

Choose the same pathway that the README gives each stakeholder:

| You are | Start here | What you can do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Owner or founder | `/dashboard` | Open the owner dashboard and organise a LEG. |
| LEG operator | `/leg/dashboard` | Manage members, contracts, metering, and billing. |
| Municipality | `/gemeinde/dashboard` | Open the municipality dashboard. |
| Developer or self-hoster | `/api/v1/docs` | Use the API or run your own instance. |

## Five minute setup

Clone the repository and enter it:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Open-LEG-ch/openleg.git
Cloning into 'openleg'...
$ cd openleg
```

Check the tools already on your machine:

```console
$ scripts/contribute doctor
Required to run the gate
OK Python: 3.12.10
OK pytest: importable
OK ruff executable: 0.16.6, matches pin
OK python3 -m ruff: 0.16.6, matches pin
Required to match CI
OK node: present
OK npm: present
OK mypy: present
Reported only
INFO .venv: absent
```

Create `.venv` and install the development dependencies:

```console
$ scripts/contribute setup
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
The current shell is unchanged. Activate the virtual environment now:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Pip writes its package installation log between the two command lines and the activation reminder. `setup` cannot activate the virtual environment for your current shell, so activate it separately. A successful `source` command has no output.

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ scripts/contribute doctor
Required to run the gate
OK Python: 3.12.10
OK pytest: importable
OK ruff executable: 0.16.6, matches pin
OK python3 -m ruff: 0.16.6, matches pin
Required to match CI
OK node: present
OK npm: present
OK mypy: present
Reported only
INFO .venv: active
```

The version numbers can change when the repository updates its pins. The status text tells you whether your checkout is ready.

## Getting oriented

Both orientation commands read `CONTEXT.md` when you run them. Start with the tour:

```console
$ scripts/contribute tour
OpenLEG orientation
Entry points
- app.py: application factory and local development server
- wsgi.py: production WSGI entry point

- store/registry: LEG registry entries and verification

- store/consent: The consent record a resident gives and can revoke
- store/document: Generated LEG documents and their signing status
- store/ops: LEA job reports and operational snapshots
- store/access_token: Hashed, single-use magic-link tokens, dashboard and municipality
Tests
- tests/: pytest tests and contract tests
Gate
- scripts/test.sh gate
```

Ask the glossary for a domain term when a name is unfamiliar:

```console
$ scripts/contribute glossary LEG
Lokale Elektrizitätsgemeinschaft. Neighbours who share locally produced electricity over the public grid at a reduced network fee. The product's reason to exist.
```

Run `scripts/contribute glossary` without a term to list every term.

## The rules that are not negotiable

- Work only with public or synthetic fixtures. Do not access production or use citizen data. The [repository boundary](repo-boundary.md) defines what stays outside this public repository.
- Contributions use AGPL-3.0-or-later. The [contribution terms](../CONTRIBUTING.md) state this license.
- `main` accepts pull requests only. Never push to it directly. The [execution rules](codex-execution.md) describe the review path.

## The change loop

1. Write one failing behavior test before implementation.
2. Run exactly that pytest node. `scripts/contribute test` defaults to the red phase.

   ```console
   $ scripts/contribute test tests/test_contributor_onboarding.py::test_onboarding_guide_is_linked_from_public_entry_points
   tests/test_contributor_onboarding.py F                                   [100%]
   FAILED tests/test_contributor_onboarding.py::test_onboarding_guide_is_linked_from_public_entry_points
   ============================== 1 failed in 0.02s ===============================
   ```

3. Implement the smallest change that makes the behavior pass.
4. Run the local gate.

   ```console
   $ scripts/contribute gate
   ```

   `scripts/contribute gate` is an alias for `scripts/test.sh gate`, the
   canonical harness pinned by `tests/test_test_harness.py`. You will also see
   `scripts/tdd_cycle.sh gate` in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md`; that runs
   the same pytest and ruff checks but resolves ruff as `<python> -m ruff`
   rather than the executable. Either goes green on a healthy machine, and
   `doctor` reports both ruff sources for exactly this reason.

5. Stage explicit paths. Never use `git add -A`. Use the paths from your change. For this guide, the command is:

   ```console
   $ git add tests/test_contributor_onboarding.py docs/contributor-onboarding.md README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
   ```

   A successful `git add` prints nothing.

6. Check the staged paths against the public repository boundary.

   ```console
   $ scripts/contribute check --staged
   ```

   A successful check prints nothing.

7. Commit, push your branch, and open a pull request against `main`. Address review comments and CI failures with the same test-first loop. A maintainer merges the pull request after review and all required checks pass.

`scripts/contribute test` accepts exactly one pytest node and no pytest flags because `scripts/tdd_cycle.sh` has that contract. A flag exits nonzero with a clear error instead of being silently dropped:

```console
$ scripts/contribute test -k something
usage: scripts/contribute [-h]
                          {doctor,check,glossary,gate,test,setup,tour} ...
scripts/contribute: error: unrecognized arguments: -k
```

## CI runs more than the local gate

The CI lint job also runs `npm ci`, `npm run build:css`, `git diff --exit-code -- static/css/openleg.css`, and `mypy`. `doctor` reports `node`, `npm`, and `mypy` for this reason. Missing CI-only tools produce warnings, not a failing doctor result, so install them before relying on local CI parity.

## Troubleshooting

Match the line from `doctor` exactly, then apply the fix.

| Exact diagnostic | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `FAIL Python: 3.9, need 3.11 or newer` | Install Python 3.11 or newer, then rerun `scripts/contribute doctor`. |
| `FAIL pytest: not found. Next: python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` | Run `scripts/contribute setup`, activate `.venv`, then rerun `doctor`. |
| `FAIL ruff executable: required 0.16.6, found 0.15.20. Next: python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` | Reinstall the development requirements in the active environment. |
| `FAIL ruff sources: ruff executable 0.15.20; python3 -m ruff 0.16.6; versions disagree. Next: python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` | Remove the stale executable from `PATH`, reinstall the development requirements, and rerun `doctor`. |
