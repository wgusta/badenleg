# OpenLEG data catalog (#516)

One section per store domain. A maintainer reads this before touching data.
Each section states: what personal or energy data it holds, its purpose, its
owner inside a LEG, its sensitivity, whether output is resident-visible, and
whether a consent gate applies. Field names are cited from
`store/schema.py`; a test pins that the catalog keeps matching the schema.

## Data policy where it binds

Citizen meter data (smart-meter readings, 15-minute series, per-building
consumption) stays within each LEG. It is never sold and never aggregated for
third parties. Resident-visible output always carries the neighbour consent
gate: an inner join on `consents.share_with_neighbors`, fail closed, and a
count uses conditions identical to its list.

## store/building

- **Tables:** `buildings`
- **Holds:** `building_id`, `email`, `address`, `lat`, `lon`, `plz`,
  `building_type`, `annual_consumption_kwh`, `potential_pv_kwp`, `user_type`,
  `verified`, `city_id`, `referrer_id`
- **Purpose:** resident registration and readiness; the map of consenting
  neighbours.
- **Owner:** the resident (each row is one household's record).
- **Sensitivity:** personal + energy; citizen meter data stays within each
  LEG and is never sold, never aggregated for third parties.
- **Resident-visible:** yes, but only consent-gated: `get_all_buildings`,
  `get_all_building_profiles` and `get_neighbor_count_near` inner-join
  consents on `share_with_neighbors = TRUE`. Self-views
  (`get_building`, `get_building_for_dashboard`) are `LEFT JOIN` by design
  because a member reads their own record.
- **Consent gate:** applies to every other-resident-visible output.

## store/consent

- **Tables:** `consents`, `data_consents`
- **Holds:** `share_with_neighbors`, `share_with_utility`, `updates_opt_in`,
  `consent_version`, `consent_timestamp`; `data_consents` carries the tier
  (`tier`), `share_with_municipality`, `share_anonymized_research`,
  `revoked_at`.
- **Purpose:** the live consent value every gate reads; revocation is
  immediate for future visibility (it does not delete past records).
- **Owner:** the resident.
- **Sensitivity:** consent data itself.
- **Resident-visible:** no direct output; it governs other outputs.
- **Consent gate:** this IS the gate.

## store/cluster

- **Tables:** `clusters`, `cluster_info`
- **Holds:** provisional cluster assignments (`building_id`, cluster id,
  scores).
- **Purpose:** formation suggestions before a LEG exists.
- **Owner:** the platform until a LEG forms; derived from consent-gated
  profiles only.
- **Sensitivity:** derived personal data; inherits the building domain's
  bounds.
- **Resident-visible:** only through consent-gated profile reads that feed
  it.
- **Consent gate:** inherited from its inputs (`get_all_building_profiles`
  is gated).

## store/metering

- **Tables:** `metering_points`, `metering_point_readings`, `sdat_imports`,
  `sdat_veracity_flags`
- **Holds:** the VNB metering point registry (`metering_point_id`,
  `vnb_community_id`) and the 15-minute E66 series (`total_kwh`, `grid_kwh`,
  `community_kwh`, `direction`, `measured_at`); the import ledger and its
  veracity flags (`window_start`, `window_end`, `kind`).
- **Purpose:** billing-grade energy accounting per metering point.
- **Owner:** the LEG whose metering points are assigned to it; data arrives
  from the VNB (validated E66 deliveries).
- **Sensitivity:** citizen meter data. Stays within each LEG, never sold,
  never aggregated for third parties.
- **Resident-visible:** neighbour-consent-gated for neighbour views
  (pinned by #509's privacy contract and the consent audit #518); operators
  see their LEG's periods.
- **Consent gate:** applies to neighbour-visible shapes.

## store/meter

- **Tables:** `meter_readings`
- **Holds:** manual/CSV smart-meter readings per building
  (`building_id`, reading date, `total_kwh`).
- **Purpose:** consumption input for readiness and early billing runs
  before SDAT metering exists.
- **Owner:** the resident.
- **Sensitivity:** citizen meter data; same LEG bounds.
- **Resident-visible:** own data only.
- **Consent gate:** not neighbour-visible.

  frozen `policy_snapshot`), per-member invoice lines, lifecycle and delivery
  state.
- **Purpose:** the LEG's financial accounting and member invoices.
- **Owner:** the LEG (operator approves); members see their own invoices.
- **Sensitivity:** financial personal data.
- **Resident-visible:** own invoices only; the operator workspace is
  admin-gated. Member display fails closed on unreadable figures (#528).

  `grid_rp_kwh`, solar potential, production/consumption MWh).
- **Purpose:** public Gemeindeprofil pages and the value-gap calculation.
- **Owner:** public data (ElCom, BFE Sonnendach, Energie Reporter), refreshed
  by the platform.
- **Sensitivity:** public; figures name their basis (`data_sources`,
  provenance panel).
- **Resident-visible:** yes, public by design.
- **Consent gate:** none (no personal data). Reads are cached per
  municipality (#527) with refresh-seam invalidation.
