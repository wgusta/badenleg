## The Strategy in 3 Sentences

1. **Prove demand:** Get 500+ verified households registered with explicit utility consent (Feb-May)
2. **Prove capability:** Build formation wizard, activate 20+ communities, submit to DSO (Mar-Jun)
3. **Prove readiness:** Create utility handoff package, ops dashboard, pitch acquisition (May-Aug)

Regionalwerke saves CHF 300-500K development cost + 12 months by acquiring you instead of building internally.

## Key Insights from Planning

### What Makes This Work

**Timing:** LEG became legal Jan 1, 2026. You're 1 month into the compliance window. Regionalwerke MUST have a solution but doesn't. You'll have 500+ customers ready to activate.

**Economics:** They need to spend CHF 300-500K building this anyway. Acquiring you gets them customers + platform + faster time to market. Net benefit: CHF 100-300K + competitive advantage.

**Proof Points:** They buy evidence, not promises. 500 verified households + 20 formed communities + utility handoff package = undeniable proof of value.

### What NOT to Do

❌ Don't build mobile apps (web sufficient)
❌ Don't build complex billing (utility has meter data)
❌ Don't build SEPA integration (not needed pre-acquisition)
❌ Don't build chat (WhatsApp sufficient)
❌ Don't chase perfection (speed wins)

✅ Build only what proves acquisition value:
- More verified households
- Formation automation
- Document generation
- Utility export package
- Ops dashboard

---

## Current State (What You Already Have)

### ✅ Production-Ready Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- Referral system with tracking
- Google Analytics 4 integration
- Formation wizard backend (670 LOC, coded but not in UI yet)
- Consent capture (explicit utility sharing flag)
- Admin endpoints (token-protected)
- Security hardening
- SendGrid email configured

### ⚠️ Needs Work
- Formation wizard UI (connect backend to frontend)
- User dashboard (readiness score, community status)
- Document generation (PDF contracts, DSO forms)
- Utility handoff package (clean exports)
- Marketing campaigns (ads, partnerships, PR)

## Key Principles to Remember

1. **Acquisition Value > Feature Completeness**
   Every feature: "Does this prove acquisition value?" If no, skip it.

2. **Speed > Perfection**
   Ship weekly. MVP beats vaporware. Iterate based on real feedback.

3. **Measure Everything**
   Track registrations, formations, consent rates, cost per acquisition. Adjust weekly.

4. **Focus on Proof Points**
   Regionalwerke buys: verified demand, formation capability, utility handoff package, operational readiness.

5. **Marketing = 50% of Success**
   Don't just build. Promote aggressively. Users won't come automatically.

## Why This Will Work

**You have everything you need:**
- ✅ Working infrastructure (database, referrals, analytics)

- ✅ Motivated buyer (Regionalwerke needs solution NOW)
- ✅ Competitive advantage (first mover in Baden)

**The market forces are aligned:**
