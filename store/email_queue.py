"""Outbound email queue repository.

Repository module for the outbound email queue domain: schedule emails for the
``scheduled_emails`` table, transition dispatch state (pending/sent/failed/
cancelled), and return queue statistics. The connection seam is resolved via
``database.get_connection`` at call time so existing tests that
``monkeypatch.setattr(database, "get_connection", ...)`` keep working
unchanged and ``database`` can re-export these functions for legacy callers.

Data hygiene (#519): the recipient address is scrubbed the moment its need
ends (sent, cancelled). Delivery failures return the entry to the queue until
``MAX_EMAIL_ATTEMPTS`` is reached, then the entry is terminal. Terminal rows
are deleted by ``cleanup_finished_emails`` after ``EMAIL_QUEUE_RETENTION_DAYS``
(90 days: wide enough for billing disputes and mail-provider bounce
diagnostics; sent and cancelled rows carry no address by then). A queue row
cannot outlive its building (FK ON DELETE CASCADE), and the pending listing
inner-joins buildings, so a row whose building is gone is never handed to the
sender.
